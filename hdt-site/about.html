 <h3>Why?</h3>
<p>
In humanitarian disasters people affected by the unfolding tragedy need more than physical necessities: They also have an urgent need for information. From earthquakes to armed conflicts, survival can depend on knowing the answers to questions such as: Is it safe to go back home? Should I stay with my family or go elsewhere for help? What is the extent of the damage? Where can I get clean water and food? What are the symptoms of cholera? Where is the nearest health facility?
<br><br>
Historically, little to no systematic attention has been given to this crucial issue; Inter-Agency Needs Assessments, for example, have not specifically looked into the communication needs of the people the humanitarian community is there to serve, which results in major gaps in aid effectiveness and downward accountability. Internews, through the infoasaid (http://infoasaid.org/) project, is working now with the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Needs Assessment Task Force (NATF) in Geneva to try to ensure that questions on access to information are an integral part of needs assessments methodology.
<br><br>
The information needs assessments, therefore, aim to both support better local humanitarian communications on the ground, and to keep building the global body of evidence around the importance of effective and efficient communication with affected populations. Understanding more and better the local information ecosystems is vital for humanitarian agencies to save lives and to be more effective in the delivery of aid.
<br><br>
In August 2011 Internews conducted a Humanitarian Information Needs assessment in Dadaab, Kenya, in partnership with Radio Ergo/International Media Support (IMS), Star FM of Kenya and with support from the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The survey was designed drawing on similar exercises conducted by Internews in other humanitarian disasters, including in Haiti in 2010, in last year’s floods in Pakistan, and during the Liberia/Cote d’Ivoire refugee crisis in June.
<br><br>
The assessment piloted for the first time the use of smartphones to record respondents’ answers in the field, in combination with paper surveys. This meant answers could be uploaded in real-time, with the promise of instantaneous data and analysis. The uploading and online data-management used the platform developed by EpiSurveyor. The pilot was overall successful in gathering data as live from the field, but it also indicated areas for improvement in post-gathering data analysis, hardware support on the ground, training and survey design methodologies.
<br><br>
The possibility of instantaneous data collection and analysis holds great promise, both to provide real-time data for fast response, and as another tool for ongoing monitoring and quality control of field research activities themselves. Internews and the Assessment Team decided to share these tools and techniques, especially as they become more refined, with any humanitarian organization who wishes to use them or test them out further.
<br><br>
The Dadaab assessment also allowed the Research team to identify best practices and refine the methodology as well as the survey template. Since then, Internews and the Humanitarian Media Project in particular, have been exploring possibilities to create a standard survey toolkit and research methodology for the Humanitarian Needs Assessments.
<br><br>
This effort has been going in, while, since August 2011, Internews as well as a number of prospective partner organizations throughout the world, have been experimenting with new tools and technologies that can make more and better information and communication accessible to disaster-affected communities, make them more resilient and strengthen local media infrastructure.

<h3>Testing a humanitarian data toolkit</h3>
 <p>
					This Toolkit is the product of a pilot project conducted in 2013 to test a humanitarian mobile data gathering kit in the field to determine which would best support the deployment of Research team for Humanitarian Information Needs Assessments. More importantly, Internews wanted to test which hardware and software technology could make possible, for a Research team in the midst of a crisis, to easily train local researchers on the ground and collect, aggregate, share and analyze information in a time span of a week.
<br><br>
					The Pilot Project to create a Digital Humanitarian Toolkit was therefore conducted in collaboration with FormHub and Captricity, respectively a mobile data gathering software tool and a digitalization tool, to create a very practical and out of the box toolkit. The Toolkit, complete with hardware and software is packaged up in a ruggedized Pelican case, ready to be deploy in 24 hours.
<br><br>
					The Modi Research Group at Columbia University provided the engineering part to design and customize the system, while Internews provided the logistical support for the on the ground testing, and the documentation as well as the drafting of the research methodology. Captricity  provided support in using their digitalization tool and integrating it with the FormHub format. A team composed by a ModiLabs, Internews and Captricity implemented the pilot project on the ground in Dadaab in February 2013. .
<br><br>
					The partners organizations used the Pilot to explore the feasibility and impact of having such a toolkit ready to deploy, and use this pilot also to refine its Information Needs Assessment methodology, both on the technical and on the conceptual point of view. The partners are particularly interested in looking at the possible customizations that can be done to make the system as easy as possible to use on the ground, while making sure to develop a strong, sustainable and robust system that can be used for all emergency assessments.
<br><br>
					The system will allow any organization that needs to do surveys on the ground in humanitarian settings to deploy the toolkit on the ground, and decide, according to the security situation, if to use paper based forms, that will then be digitized in maximum 24 hours, or digital surveys collected through mobile phones, that will then be aggregated and analyzed on the spot.
<br><br>
					The Mobile Data Toolkit for Humanitarian Information Needs Assessments has been designed, tested in a real situation and then finalized. The parts list, reference manuals and training guides are freely available under a creative commons license. The entire pilot project has been “live streamed” via a blog, where the three organizations have keep track of what they are doing, challenges and successes.
